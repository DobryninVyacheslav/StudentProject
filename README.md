# StudentProject

Training project from [Anton Saburov](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyxk-1FCKqockmP-fXZmHQ7UlYP3qvZRa)

StudentProject is an application for providing payments to student families with children.
After the students submit an order, the application checks the children's registration, city registration,
marriage registration and checks if they are indeed students.
If all checks are successful, the order is accepted.

Technologies currently used in the project:
- Java 11
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- slf4j and log4j
- JUnit 4
- Git
- Multithreading
- Sockets
- Apache Tomcat


I am doing this project to gain additional knowledge required to write Enterprise applications.
